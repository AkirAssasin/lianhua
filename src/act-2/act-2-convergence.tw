:: Act 2 Convergence

Under the guidance of the Master <<= $wrongClass.toUpperFirst()>>, you become somewhat familiar with the holy $wrongWeapon. You're about to have a little celebration with your friends $friend1 and $friend2, but it seems that the demons have the same idea...

!!"LET'S MOOOOOO AND PARTY!"

Accompanied by earthquake-inducing roars and chants of demons, the Demon Lord Niu Mo Wang proclaims his arrival. You and your friends look to the Master <<= $wrongClass.toUpperFirst()>> for help - only to remember that he had left yesterday. Left with no choice, you challenge the demon lord to make him stop.
